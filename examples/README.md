# Sinter Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating all functionality of the Sinter validation library. Each example file is executable and covers specific aspects of Sinter's capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

All examples are executable Elixir scripts. To run any example:

```bash
# From the project root
cd examples
elixir basic_usage.exs
```

### Run All Examples at Once

For a comprehensive test of all functionality:

```bash
# From the project root (recommended)
cd examples && elixir run_all.exs

# Or from the examples directory
cd examples
elixir run_all.exs
```

**Important**: The script must be run from within the `examples/` directory so it can find the example files.

This will execute all examples in sequence and provide a summary report with:
- ✅ Success/failure status for each example
- ⏱️ Execution timing for performance analysis  
- 📊 Comprehensive summary statistics
- 🔗 Next steps and troubleshooting guidance

  echo "=== Running $file ==="
  elixir "$file"
  echo ""
done
```

```

**Want to verify README examples work?**
```bash
elixir readme_comprehensive.exs
```

**Using Sinter with DSPy?**

## 🔧 Customizing Examples

All examples are designed to be easily modified. Common patterns:

### Adding Your Own Schema
```elixir
# Add this to any example file
my_schema = Sinter.Schema.define([
  {:my_field, :string, [required: true]},
  # ... more fields
])

{:ok, result} = Sinter.Validator.validate(my_schema, %{my_field: "test"})
IO.puts("My validation result: #{inspect(result)}")
```

### Testing Different Constraints
```elixir
# Modify constraint examples
test_constraints = [
  {:score, :integer, [required: true, gteq: 0, lteq: 100]},
  {:email, :string, [required: true, format: ~r/YOUR_PATTERN/]}
]
```

### Performance Testing
```elixir
# Add performance tests to any example
start_time = System.monotonic_time(:microsecond)
# ... your operations ...
end_time = System.monotonic_time(:microsecond)
IO.puts("Operation took: #{end_time - start_time}μs")
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Missing Dependencies
If you see module loading errors:
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root and deps are installed
mix deps.get
cd examples
elixir your_example.exs
```

### Path Issues
Examples use `Code.append_path("../_build/dev/lib/sinter/ebin")` to load compiled Sinter modules. If this fails:
```bash
# Compile the project first, then run from examples directory
cd examples
mix compile
elixir your_example.exs
```

### Module Not Found
If you get `** (UndefinedFunctionError)`:
```bash
# Compile the project first
mix compile
cd examples
elixir your_example.exs
```

## 🤝 Contributing Examples

Found a use case not covered? Add an example!

1. Create a new `.exs` file following the existing pattern
2. Use the same header format with `#!/usr/bin/env elixir`
3. Add `Code.append_path("lib")` for module loading
4. Structure with clear sections using comments
5. Include both success and error cases
6. Add performance timing where relevant
7. Update this README with your new example

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

- **Run examples in order** - later examples build on concepts from earlier ones
- **Modify and experiment** - all examples are designed to be tweaked
- **Check the output** - examples include detailed logging to show what's happening
- **Time operations** - several examples include performance measurements
- **Compare approaches** - see how different patterns solve similar problems
